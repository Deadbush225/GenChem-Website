			<p>
				A chemical bond is the association of two or more atoms that occurs when
				they are drawn to one another and combine to form a molecule. This bond
				acts to hold the atoms together and can be permanent, until it is broken
				by an outside force or energy. The chemical bond is formed when one atom
				has less energy than the other, and the attraction between them is
				strong enough to form a stable compound. The primary bonds include the
				covalent, ionic, and metallic bonds.
			</p>
			<h2 id="types">Different Types of Chemical Bonding</h2>
			<h3 id="1-ionic-bonding">1. Ionic Bonding</h3>
			<p>
				Ionic bonding is a type of chemical bond that is created when electrons
				are transferred between a positively charged atom (the cation) and a
				negatively charged atom (the anion). Typically, this type of interaction
				occurs between metals and nonmetals. This electron transfer results in
				the formation of an electrovalent bond between the two ions, causing the
				cation to become positively charged and the anion to become negatively
				charged. The cation is formed from the original atom by losing one or
				more electrons, while the anion is formed from the original atom by
				gaining one or more electrons. The name of the anion is determined by
				changing the elemental name with an -ide suffix.
			</p>
			<h4 id="examples">Examples:</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>sodium chloride: NaCl, with Na+ and Cl- ions</li>
				<li>lithium nitride: Li3N, with Li+ and N3- ions</li>
				<li>magnesium oxide: MgO, with Mg2+ and O2- ions</li>
				<li>calcium phosphide: Ca3P2, with Ca2+ and P3- ions</li>
			</ul>
			<h4 id="properties-of-ionic-bond">Properties of Ionic Bond:</h4>
			<ol>
				<li>
					Ionic bonds possess a high lattice energy, which is the energy
					necessary to completely separate the ions in an orderly crystal. This
					is due to the considerable electrostatic forces between the ions.
				</li>
				<li>
					The strong attractions between the ions result in ionic compounds
					having high melting and boiling points. It takes a lot of energy to
					break the bonds and cause the compound to melt or boil.
				</li>
				<li>
					In its solid form, ionic compounds are not good conductors of
					electricity due to the ions being securely held in a lattice
					arrangement. However, they become good conductors when in an aqueous
					solution or molten state.&nbsp;
				</li>
				<li>
					The strong electrostatic attractions between the ions and the polar
					water molecules cause many ionic compounds to be soluble in water.
				</li>
			</ol>
			<h3 id="2-covalent-bonding">2. Covalent Bonding</h3>
			<p>
				The sharing of electrons between atoms is known as covalent bonding.
				This bonding happens when two atoms of the same or closely related
				elements in the periodic table come together. Although it can also be
				seen between nonmetals and metals, this bonding primarily occurs between
				nonmetals.
			</p>
			<p>
				Covalent bonds are most likely to form when two atoms have comparable
				electronegativities or the same affinity for electrons. They share
				electrons to achieve octet configuration and gain stability because both
				atoms have the same affinity for electrons, and neither has a strong
				tendency to donate them. Furthermore, the atom's ionization energy is
				too high, and its electron affinity is too low for ionic bonding.
			</p>
			<p>
				For example: Carbon cannot form ionic bonds because it has only four
				valence electrons or half an octet. Carbon molecules must either gain or
				lose 4 electrons to form ionic bonds. Since this is very unfavorable,
				carbon molecules share their four valence electrons through single,
				double, and triple bonds, allowing each atom to adopt a noble gas
				configuration. Covalent bonds involve interactions between the sigma and
				pi orbitals; as a result, covalent bonds lead to the formation of
				single, double, triple, and quadruple bonds.
			</p>
			<h4 id="covalent-bonding-can-be-achieved-in-two-ways">
				Covalent Bonding can be Achieved in two Ways:
			</h4>
			<ol>
				<li>Sharing of electrons between atoms of the same kind&nbsp;</li>
				<ul>
					<li>E.g. Formation of H2, Cl2, O2, etc.</li>
				</ul>
				<li>Sharing of electrons between atoms of different kind&nbsp;</li>
				<ul>
					<li>E.g. Formation of CH4, H2O, NH3, etc.</li>
				</ul>
			</ol>
			<h4 id="properties-of-covalent-bond">Properties of Covalent Bond</h4>
			<p>
				If sharing a single electron pair between atoms does not satisfy an
				atom's normal valence, the atoms may share more than one electron pair.
				The following are some of the properties of covalent bonds:&nbsp;
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Covalent bonding does not result in the formation of new electrons.
					They are only paired together by the bond.
				</li>
				<li>Extremely strong chemical bonds connect atoms.</li>
				<li>
					A covalent bond typically contains about 80 kilocalories per mole
					(kcal/mol) of energy.
				</li>
				<li>Covalent bonds rarely break on their own after they are formed.</li>
				<li>
					Covalent bonds are directional, with the bonded atoms showing specific
					orientations relative to one another.
				</li>
				<li>
					Most covalently bound compounds have relatively low melting and
					boiling points.
				</li>
				<li>
					Covalent bonds typically have lower enthalpies of vaporization and
					fusion.
				</li>
				<li>
					Covalently bonded components lack free electrons, which prevents them
					from conducting electricity.
				</li>
				<li>Covalent compounds are not soluble in water.</li>
			</ul>
			<h5 id="1-polar-covalent-bond">1. Polar Covalent Bond</h5>
			<p>
				This type of covalent bond exists when the electronegativity of
				combining atoms varies significantly, resulting in unequal electron
				sharing. More electronegative atoms will attract electrons with greater
				force. Between the atoms, there is an electronegative difference that is
				greater than 0 but less than 2.0. As a result, the atom will be closer
				to the shared pair of electrons.
			</p>
			<p>
				<em
					>Example: molecules forming hydrogen bonding as a result of an
					unbalanced electrostatic potential. In this case, the hydrogen atom
					interacts with electronegative fluorine, hydrogen, or oxygen.</em
				>
			</p>
			<h5 id="2-nonpolar-covalent-bond">2. Nonpolar Covalent Bond</h5>
			<p>
				This type of covalent bond is formed when two atoms share equal
				electrons. The electronegativity difference between two atoms is zero.
				It occurs whenever the atoms combined have a similar electron affinity
				(diatomic elements).
			</p>
			<p>
				<em
					>Example: Nonpolar Covalent Bond is found in gas molecules like
					Hydrogen gas, Nitrogen gas, etc.</em

			</p>
			<h3 id="3-metallic">3. Metallic</h3>
			<p>
				A metallic bond is a particular kind of chemical bond created between
				positively charged atoms in which the free electrons are distributed
				among a lattice of cations. Ionic and covalent bonds, on the other hand,
				develop between two distinct atoms. The primary chemical bond between
				metal atoms is known as metallic bonding.
			</p>
			<p>
				Metallic bonds can be found in pure metals, alloys, and some metalloids.
				For example, the carbon allotrope graphene demonstrates two-dimensional
				metallic bonding. Even the most refined metals can create chemical bonds
				between their atoms. For instance, the mercurous ion (Hg22+) can create
				covalent bonds between metals. Covalent bonds are formed by pure gallium
				between atom pairs connected to surrounding pairs by metallic bonds.
			</p>
			<h4 id="the-factors-that-affect-the-strength-of-a-metallic-bond-include">
				The factors that affect the strength of a metallic bond include:
			</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Total number of delocalized electrons.</li>
				<li>Magnitude of positive charge held by the metal cation.</li>

			</ul>
			<h4 id="properties-attributed-by-metallic-bonding">
				Properties Attributed by Metallic Bonding
			</h4>
			<p>
				Metallic bonds impart several important properties to metals that make
				them commercially desirable. Some of these properties are briefly
				described in this subsection.
			</p>
			<h5 id="1-electrical-conductivity">1. Electrical Conductivity</h5>
			<p>
				Electrical conductivity is a measurement of a material's capacity to
				permit the passage of a charge through it. Any electric current passed
				through the metal passes through it because the movement of electrons in
				the electron sea is not constrained, as shown in the illustration
				below.<br />
				<img
					src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/44RY174Lmz3lriB2jiTaEqPBr5DNhiBDluDpLbighrt7-5Ufo4Na-XH066ZD8pUQ05n7bhLtC6zpG5-Cf0o8SLLww0O4S-SHqMb3YRFU_Gh3_DJRLzqLkfMerFXR-WlqFtbFXoidfa-Y7gMfsJ52SXA"
					alt=""
				/>
			</p>
			<p>
				The delocalized electrons begin to move in the direction of the positive
				charge when a potential difference is applied to the metal. Metals are
				typically effective conductors of electric current because of this.
			</p>
			<h5 id="2-thermal-conductivity">2. Thermal Conductivity</h5>
			<p>
				A material's capacity to conduct or transfer heat is determined by its
				thermal conductivity. The kinetic energy of the electrons in that region
				increases when one end of a metallic substance is heated. Through
				collisions, these electrons impart their kinetic energies to other
				electrons in the water.
			</p>
			<p>
				The speed at which kinetic energy is transferred depends on the
				electrons' mobility. The delocalized electrons are highly mobile because
				of metallic bonds, which allows them to transfer heat through the
				metallic substance by crashing into other electrons.
			</p>
			<h5 id="3-malleability-and-ductility">3. Malleability and Ductility</h5>
			<p>
				An ionic crystal, such as sodium chloride, breaks into numerous smaller
				pieces when struck with a hammer. This is due to the crystals' atoms
				being held together by a rigid lattice that is difficult to deform. The
				crystal breaks when a force (from the hammer) is applied, fracturing the
				crystal structure.
			</p>
			<p>
				The sea of electrons in the metallic bond allows the lattice to deform
				in the case of metals. As a result, the rigid lattice is deformed rather
				than fractured when metals are hammered with a hammer. Metals can be
				beaten into thin sheets because of this. Metals are referred to as being
				highly ductile because these lattices do not easily fracture.
			</p>
			<h5 id="4-metallic-luster">4. Metallic Luster</h5>
			<p>
				Metals are usually shiny or have a metallic luster. Once a certain
				minimum thickness is reached, they become opaque. Photons are reflected
				off the smooth surface by the electron sea. The light that can be
				reflected is restricted to a specific upper frequency.
			</p>
			<p>
				Metals possess a high density, a high melting point, a high boiling
				point, and low volatility due to the strong attraction between the atoms
				in their metallic bonds, which also gives them strength. There are some
				exceptions. For instance, mercury has a high vapor pressure and is a
				liquid under normal circumstances. All the metals in the zinc group (Zn,
				Cd, and Hg) are relatively volatile.
			</p>
			<h5 id="5-high-melting-and-boiling-points">
				5. High Melting and Boiling Points
			</h5>
			<p>
				The attraction between the metal atoms is substantial due to the solid
				metallic bonding. A significant amount of energy is required to overcome
				this force of attraction. This explains why melting and boiling points
				for metals are frequently high. This does not apply to zinc, cadmium, or
				mercury (explained by their electron configurations, which end with
				ns2).
			</p>
			<p>
				Even when metal is in a molten state, the metallic bond can still be
				strong. Gallium, for instance, melts at 29.76 C but only boils at 2400
				C. As a result, molten gallium is a nonvolatile liquid.

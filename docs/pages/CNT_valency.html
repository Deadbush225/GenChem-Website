			<h2 id="valence-electrons">Valence Electrons</h2>
			<p>
				Valence electrons are the s and p electrons in the outermost shell. The
				electrons present in the inner shell are core electrons. When we study
				and observe the atom of an element, we come across tiny subatomic
				particles called valence electrons. Lewis structures help us to track
				the valence electrons and predict the types of bonds.
			</p>
			<p>
				Valence electrons are all arranged in different orbitals or shells and
				are mostly negatively charged particles. Further, these electrons are
				responsible for the interaction between atoms and the formation of
				chemical bonds. However, not all electrons are associated with the atom.
				Only the electrons present in the outermost shell can participate in the
				formation of a chemical bond or a molecule. Such a type of electron is
				called a valence electron.
			</p>
			<h2 id="what-are-valence-electrons">What are Valence Electrons?</h2>
			<p>
				Valence is the number of electrons an atom must lose or gain to attain
				the nearest noble gas or inert gas electron configuration. “Electrons in
				the outer shells that are not filled are called valence electrons.
			</p>
			<p>
				The valence electrons are part of the chemical reactions because they
				contain more energy compared to the electrons present in inner orbits.
				Meanwhile, the number of valence electrons present also helps us
				determine a specific element’s chemical properties, such as its valence
				or valency, and the formation of bonds with other elements. It also
				gives us an idea of how readily the atoms can form bonds, the number of
				unpaired electrons, and how many atoms can take part.
			</p>
			<h3 id="characteristics-of-valence-electron">
				Characteristics of Valence Electron
			</h3>
			<p>
				Electrons are involved in the chemical bonding and reactions of the
				atom. It is said to occupy orbitals in an atom. The number of valence
				electrons of an atom can be obtained from the periodic table because it
				is equal to the group number of the atom. Atoms are most stable if they
				have a filled valence shell of electrons. Atoms transfer or share
				electrons in such a way that they can attain a filled shell of
				electrons.
			</p>
			<h4 id="some-key-characteristics-of-a-valence-electron-are">
				Some key characteristics of a valence electron are;
			</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>
					For the main group elements, the valence electron exists only in the
					outermost electron shell.
				</li>
				<li>
					A valence electron can exist in the inner shell of a transition metal.
				</li>
				<li>
					An atom consisting of a closed shell of valence electrons will usually
					be chemically inert.
				</li>
				<li>
					A valence electron can either absorb or release energy in the form of
					a photon.
				</li>
				<li>
					Valence electrons also determine the electrical conductivity of an
					element. Depending on the nature of the elements can be metal,
					non-metal, or metalloid.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 id="determination-of-valence-electrons">
				Determination of Valence Electrons
			</h3>
			<p>
				One of the easiest ways to find valence electrons is by checking out the
				elements’ place in the periodic table. The valence electrons of an
				element can be found by closely examining the vertical column in which
				the elements are grouped. By looking at the group number that is given
				we can identify the number of valence electrons that an element that is
				listed under that specific column has.
			</p>
			<p>
				Another way to find or determine valence electrons is by knowing the
				electronic configuration.
			</p>
			<p>
				However, if we take the transition metals (groups 3-12), finding the
				valence electron is quite complicated. These elements’ atomic structure
				is rigid and the d subshell is incomplete and sits lower than the outer
				shell.

			<h4 id="how-do-you-find-the-valence-electrons">
				How do you find the valence electrons?
			</h4>
			<p>
				For neutral atoms, the number of valence electrons is equal to the
				atom’s main group number. The main group number for an element can be
				found from its column on the periodic table. For example, carbon is in
				group 4 and has 4 valence electrons. Oxygen is in group 6 and has 6
				valence electrons.
			</p>
			<h4 id="what-is-a-valence-electron-with-an-example">
				What is a valence electron with an example?
			</h4>
			<p>
				The total number of electrons present in the last shell orbit is known
				as valence electrons. For example: Oxygen has 6 electrons present in the
				last orbital shell hence 6 is the valence electron.
			</p>
			<h4 id="what-is-called-valency">What is called valency?</h4>
			<p>
				Valency is the combining power of an element. Elements in the same group
				of the periodic table have the same valency. The valency of an element
				is related to how many electrons are in the outer shell.
			</p>
			<h4 id="what-is-the-purpose-of-valence-electrons">
				What is the purpose of valence electrons?
			</h4>
			<p>
				Valence electrons are the outer-shell electrons of an atom. Valence
				electrons determine the reactivity of an atom.
			</p>
			<h4 id="how-do-valence-electrons-work">How do valence electrons work?</h4>
			<p>
				Valence electrons are the electrons located at the outermost shell of an
				atom. Because when two atoms interact, the electrons in the outermost
				shells are the first ones to come into contact with each other and are
				the ones that determine how an atom will react in a chemical reaction.

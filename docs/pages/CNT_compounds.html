        <p>
            All matter is made up of elements, which are the building blocks of
            matter. Standard chemical methods cannot decompose any substance into
            simpler substances. A basic component of a whole is an element. When
            defining elements, any type of element has been considered an element in
            and of itself.
        </p>
        <p>
            One type of particle, the Atom, contains protons, neutrons, and
            electrons and is the building block of all elements. An element's atoms
            all have the same number of protons. Examples of elements: Hydrogen,
            Carbon, Oxygen, Nitrogen, Gold, Silver, Iron, and Calcium. An element is
            a simple substance that cannot be divided into smaller components or
            transformed into another substance.

        <h2 id="what-are-compounds">What are Compounds?</h2>
        <p>
            Compound is known when two or more elements chemically combine in a
            fixed ratio by mass. A compound can be defined as a substance consisting
            of 2 or more elements in a fixed ratio of their atoms. Compound mixes
            comprise a significant number of materials. Physical separation
            techniques such as precipitation and distillation can be used to obtain
            pure substances. Compounds can be broken down into their parts to
            various degrees or transformed into new compounds via chemical
            processes. Atoms assemble form molecules in set quantities, dividing
            compounds from solutions and other mechanical combinations.

        <p>
            Any hydrogen-containing molecule that can transfer a proton to another
            substance is an acid, which can be recognized by its sour taste. While
            the Lowry-Bronsted definition describes an acid as a proton donor,
            Arrhenius originally defined acids as compounds that ionize to create
            hydrogen ions. This is clarified by the Lewis definition, which states
            that acids are molecules or ions capable of coordinating with unshared
            electron pairs. Thus, any electron-deficient molecule or ion can be
            regarded as an acid in the Lewis sense.

        <h4 id="2-base">2. Base</h4>
        <p>
            A base is a molecule or ion that can absorb the hydrogen ion from an
            acid. It can be identified by its bitter taste and slippery feel.
            According to Arrhenius, bases are chemicals that, when ionized, produce
            hydroxide ions. Additionally, a base serves as a proton acceptor,
            following the Lowry-Bronsted definition, and bases are defined by the
            Lewis definition as being molecules or ions that can interact with acids
            due to the availability of unshared electron pairs.

            <li>
                The aqueous solutions of bases are effective electrical conductors.

        <h4 id="1-organic">1. Organic</h4>
        <p>
            Everything on Earth that is or was alive is built from organic
            compounds. Organic compounds are generally defined as molecules that
            contain carbon atoms bonded to hydrogen atoms. The core feature of what
            makes a compound organic is its backbone of carbon atoms. However, the
            reason why the specific mention of carbon-hydrogen bonds is important in
            the definition of organic compounds is that a few inorganic compounds,
            like carbon dioxide (CO2), contain carbon.
        </p>
        <p>Examples:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Carbohydrates</li>
            <li>fats(lipids)</li>
            <li>proteins</li>
            <li>nucleic acids.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="2-inorganic">2. Inorganic</h4>
        <p>
            Inorganic compounds include all molecules without the element carbon and
            a few molecules with carbon, but no carbon-hydrogen bonds. The
            difference between organic and inorganic compounds can also be defined
            by where these compounds are found. Inorganic compounds are commonly
            found in abiotic (nonliving) structures and components, while organic
            compounds are produced by and found in biotic (living) organisms,

            Chemically pure substances that can be found in nature are called
            elements and compounds. A compound is made up of different elements in
            predetermined ratios, as opposed to an element, which is a substance
            composed of the same sort of atoms.

                the names, symbols, atomic numbers, melting and boiling points,
                densities, and ionization energies that distinguish them from one
                another. Element symbols are used to represent groups of elements with
                similar chemical properties that are ordered in the Periodic Table
                according to their atomic number.

        <ul>
            <li>
                The number of protons in an element's atomic nucleus is its atomic
                number, which is represented by the symbol Z. E.g. As carbon has a
                nucleus with six protons, Z = 6. Indicators of an electric charge or
                the number of electrons in the nucleus, which influence the element's
                chemical properties, include the presence of multiple protons.

        <h4 id="atomic-massnbsp">Atomic Mass&nbsp;</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus of an atom of an
                element, as represented by the symbol A, is known as the atomic mass
                of the element. The atomic masses of different isotopes of the same
                element vary.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="isotopesnbsp">Isotopes&nbsp;</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The nucleus of an element's isotopes all contain the same amount of
                protons, but the neutron count varies. There are several stable
                isotopes of every element that occurs in nature. Because they have the
                same amount of protons, isotopes share similar chemical properties,
                but they have different nuclear properties (due to the different
                numbers of neutrons). E.g. The three isotopes of carbon are carbon-12,
                carbon-13, and carbon-14.

        </ul>

        <ul>
            <li>
                An element's atoms can connect in a variety of ways, resulting in
                variations in the chemical characteristics of the element. For
                instance, layers of carbon hexagons combine to produce graphite, and
                carbon binds in a tetrahedron to form a diamond.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="compoundsnbsp">Compounds&nbsp;</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                are made up of various components at a set ratio. One molecule of
                sodium chloride (NaCl) is created, for instance, when one sodium (Na)
                atom and one chlorine (Cl) atom combine. The components of a compound
                don't always retain their original characteristics and can't be
                physically separated. The valency of the elements makes it easier to
                combine them. The number of hydrogen atoms needed to form a compound
                with an atom of an element is known as valency. When temperatures are
                low enough, most substances can exist as solids and can be broken down
                by heat. Compounds occasionally develop non-homogeneous structures as
                a result of foreign components becoming trapped inside the crystal
                structure. Compounds are represented by their chemical formula, which
                follows the Hill system and lists the carbon and hydrogen atoms first,
                followed by the alphabetical listing of the elements.

        <h3 id="visualizing-the-differences">Visualizing the Differences</h3>
        <p>
            Compounds have more types of atoms than elements, which only have one.
            Both elements and compounds are types of substances, as opposed to
            mixes, which involve the mixing of several substances without the need
            for atomic bonds.

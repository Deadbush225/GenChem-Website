			<h2 id="what-is-a-chemical-reaction">What is a Chemical Reaction?</h2>
			<p>
				Chemical reaction is the transformation of one or more substances, known
				reactants, into new substances, known as products. This transition
				typically entails atom rearrangement as well as the breaking and
				building of chemical bonds. Energy is either received from or discharged
				into the environment during a chemical process. <br />
				Some examples of chemical reactions are:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Photosynthesis: 6CO2 + 6H2O + Light Energy → C6H12O6 + 6O2</li>
				<li>Combustion of Methane: CH4 + 2O2 → CO2 + 2H2O</li>
				<li>Burning of Coal: C + O2 → CO2</li>
				<li>Rusting of Iron: Fe + O2 + H2O → Fe2O3 + H2</li>
				<li>Neutralization of an Acid and a Base: HCl + NaOH → NaCl + H2O</li>
			</ol>
			<h3 id="the-law-of-conservation-of-mass">
				The Law of Conservation of Mass
			</h3>
			<p>
				The conservation of mass principle, which is fundamental in physics and
				chemistry, asserts that the mass of a closed system remains unchanged
				over the course of time. This indicates that mass can only be modified
				or restructured, not created or destroyed, by physical or chemical
				events.
			</p>
			<p>
				Way back 1700s, Antoine Lavoisier conducted experiments in a sealed jar
				to estimate the mass of reactants and products in chemical processes. He
				discovered that the entire mass of the jar and its contents remained
				constant before and after the reaction, proving that matter cannot be
				created or destroyed by chemical reactions. This fundamental concept has
				significant importance in chemistry, as it allows for the balancing of
				chemical equations and the prediction of the amount of product produced
				from a given quantity of reactants.
			</p>
			<h3 id="1-synthesis-reactiondirect-combination-reaction">
				1. Synthesis Reaction/Direct Combination Reaction
			</h3>
			<p>
				Synthesis reaction or direct combination reaction is a type of chemical
				reaction that involves the integration of two or more simple molecules
				(reactants) to create a more complex compound (product). It is
				characterized by the fact that the product has a higher molecular weight
				than the reactants. The general equation for a synthesis reaction is:
			</p>
			<p>A + B → AB</p>
			<p>
				In this reaction, A and B are the reactants, and AB is the product. The
				reactants may be elements, compounds, or both. <br />
				Examples:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					The reaction of hydrogen and nitrogen to form ammonia:
					<ul>
						<li>3 H2(g) + N2(g) → 2 NH3(g)</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					The reaction of sodium and chlorine to form sodium chloride:&nbsp;
					<ul>
						<li>2Na + Cl2 → 2NaCl</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					The reaction of potassium and chlorine to form potassium chloride:
					<br />
					<ul>
						<li>2 K(s) + Cl2(g) → 2 KCl(s)</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<h3 id="2-chemical-decompositionanalysis-reaction">
				2. Chemical Decomposition/Analysis Reaction
			</h3>
			<p>
				Chemical decomposition reaction or analysis reaction is a widely
				observed type of chemical reaction that involves the breakdown of a
				compound into smaller chemical components, forming two or more products.
				This type of reaction occurs when a compound is heated, exposed to
				light, or treated with an electric current, causing the bonds between
				the atoms to break down. This process can be represented by the equation
				AB → A + B, where the compound AB is broken down into its constituent
				parts, A and B.
			</p>
			<p>Examples:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					Electrolysis of water: Water decomposes into hydrogen gas and oxygen
					gas when an electric current passed through it.
					<ul>
						<li>
							The chemical equation for this reaction is 2 H2O(l) → 2 H2(g) +
							O2(g)
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					Thermal decomposition of calcium carbonate: Calcium carbonate
					decomposes into calcium oxide and carbon dioxide gas when heated.
					<ul>
						<li>
							The chemical equation for this reaction is CaCO3 (s) → CaO(s) +
							CO2(g).
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					Photodecomposition of silver chloride: Silver chloride decomposes into
					silver metal and chlorine gas when it is exposed to sunlight.
					<ul>
						<li>
							The chemical equation for this reaction is 2AgCl(s) → 2Ag(s) +
							Cl2(g).
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<h3 id="3-single-replacement-or-substitution-reaction">
				3. Single Replacement or Substitution Reaction
			</h3>
			<p>
				A single replacement reaction or substitution reaction is a type of
				chemical reaction that happens when one element in a compound is
				replaced or displaced by another. It is frequently observed in redox
				processes, which involve the transfer of electrons between species. This
				type of reaction can be described by the chemical equation A + BC → AC +
				B, where the element A displaces B from the compound BC to generate AC
				and B as distinct products. <br />
				Examples:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					Zinc metal reacts with hydrochloric acid to produce zinc chloride and
					hydrogen gas:
					<ul>
						<li>Zn(s)&nbsp; + 2HCl(aq)→ ZnCl2(aq)+ H2(g)</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					Copper metal reacts with silver nitrate solution to produce copper(II)
					nitrate solution and silver metal:
					<ul>
						<li>Cu(s)+2AgNO3​(aq)⟶Cu(NO3)2​(aq)+2Ag(s).</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					Iron metal reacts with copper(II) sulfate solution to produce iron(II)
					sulfate solution and copper metal:
					<ul>
						<li>Fe(s) + CuSO₄ (aq) → FeSO₄ (aq) + Cu(s)</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<h3 id="4-double-replacement-reaction-or-salt-metathesis-reaction">
				4. Double-Replacement Reaction or Salt Metathesis Reaction
			</h3>
			<p>
				Double-replacement reaction or salt metathesis reaction is a type of
				chemical reaction in which two compounds switch ions or bonds with each
				other to generate novel compounds. They are commonly observed in aqueous
				solutions and can result in the formation of a precipitate, gas or water
				as a product. This can be represented using the chemical equation:&nbsp;
			</p>
			<p>AB + CD → AD + CB.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					Formation of Silver Chloride:
					<ul>
						<li>AgNO3 + NaCl → AgCl + NaNO3</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					Formation of Barium Sulfate and Sodium Chloride:
					<ul>
						<li>BaCl2(aq) + Na2SO4(aq) → BaSO4(s) + 2 NaCl(aq)</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					Formation of Potassium Nitrate and Lead Iodide:
					<ul>
						<li>Pb(NO3)2(aq) + 2 Kl(aq) → 2 KNO3(aq) + Pbl2(s)</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
